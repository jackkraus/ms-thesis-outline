LHC and ATLAS Experiment
- This is how we take the physically relevant
- ![[Pasted image 20240925181605.png]]
- and make it into data, 
	- particle hits calorimeter > cal registers voltage > voltage is then sent to trigger system
	- trigger system identifies whether this event is an interesting one
	- if it is, then all of the data is sent away for long term storage 
	- Bunches of protons cross every 25 ns, which makes the rate the trigger system 40 MHz [source](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1457044)
- how we identify what is interesting from that data, 
- how we analyze it and draw conclusions about the data.
