Theory: 
- This is what's physically relevant
	
	- Interactions ()
		- **what are the various calorimeters there to measure?** [source](https://atlas.cern/Discover/Detector/Calorimeter)
			- really just the energy of the particles
	
- What properties we can use about these particles to create an experiment
	- Charge
	- Transverse Momentum
	- Angle
- and what we expect to find
	- we expect to identify a specific interaction by taking events that occur
